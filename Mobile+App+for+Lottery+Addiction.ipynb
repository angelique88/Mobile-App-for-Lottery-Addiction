    "Many people start playing the lottery for fun, but for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into addiction. Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending from their savings and loans, they start to accumulate debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft.\n",

    "A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to **create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first version of the app, they want us to **focus on the 6/49 lottery** and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?**\n",
    "- **What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?**\n",
    "- **What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The institute also wants us to consider historical data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. The data set has data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018"
